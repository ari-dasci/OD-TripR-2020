"d680501,g186338,London,""Oxo Tower Restaurant, Bar and Brasserie"",Restaurant,""You don't go to the Oxo Tower Brasserie for a quiet meal in relaxing surroundings. This is a restaurant with a buzz - open plan kitchen, lots of action, tables which are close together, high ceilings and not one thing in the place to deaden the noise and chatter. Despite all this we loved it. It makes a change sometimes to go somewhere where there is such an atmosphere and not eat in a restaurant where you feel you cannot talk above a whisper. The choice on the menu and the meals served were very good whilst the service was excellent - attentive, friendly and not rushed. The biggest plus however for this restaurant is the view of the Thames - fantastic (which probably reflects in the slightly high cost of the meal) but worth noting that not all the tables have a great view. However, we would be so happy to return again, especially in better weather where you could sit outside on the terrace."",Date of visit: October 2014,4,4,4,4,Very enjoyable lunch,UID_e6,uk,anonymized6";

The service was swift and efficient without being rushed and the atmosphere was lively without any pretentiousness.

"d680501,g186338,London,""Oxo Tower Restaurant, Bar and Brasserie"",Restaurant,""Been around the block a few times this place. If I am honest I had never had a decent meal here previously, so I approached with much scepticism. Promising start with a good selection of local beers, including a Beavertown, mixed in with more traditional european offerings. Things took a slight turn for the worse as it took ages to get to our table, I would say a good hour. Anyway, worth waiting, as we got a great table near the window. Much have been inspired by the view as I went for fish and fish. Started with the squid, which was slightly overcooked and not quite crispy. May seem odd but this is how it turned up. Well seasoned and fresh aioli though and plenty of fish added together to make a decent dish. For the main I had the scallops, which again were plentiful, with fantastic flavours and perfectly cooked. Had a really decent bottle of Chablis to wash it down with. Didn't get round to dessert, which I think was a combination of the time, knocking on for 4 by the time we had finished, and the size of the portions. Service was perfectly attentive but unintrusive throughout.

The quality of the ingredients were excellent and everything was beautifully cooked. We enjoyed it so much we went back for lunch the following day. The menu mainly features British dishes but it has some unusual additions as well. This is not fine dining but our meal was very good and the service was excellent, prompt, attentive and polite. It is not that expensive, for London, but it does add up when you add a few extras.

"d731402,g186338,London,The Wolseley,Restaurant,""The Wolseley is like an institute in London, like a fine wine it matures with age. The location is right next door to the Ritz Hotel on Piccadilly and the dining room is large with high celiings and period features. We have visited the restaurant quite a few times now and it has never let us down.Firstly the dress code is somewhat different to other restaurants. Some diners will be in suits and cocktail dresses, others will be dressed Smart casual whilst the end of the day shoppers are wearing their casual everyday clothes. However nobody looks out of place here, you can really wear what you want in this restaurant. This is what makes the restaurant unique in my opinion, if the Wolseley was to be awarded a Michelin this would ruin the whole ambience of the place.Service is always elegant without being pretentious";" the atmosphere is always lively with a lovely buzz humming around the place. There if a general feeling of friendliness and I can’t quite put my finger on it’s origin. On our last visit we had a crayfish & lobster starter, which was fantastic, the eggs benedict was the best that I had ever had and the steak dishes were better than a lot of the steakhouse offerings.In all we had 2x starters, 2 mains, 1 side, 1 dessert, 2 glasses of wine and bottled water. In total and with service charge the bill came to £117, which is very reasonable for London standards in such a location. The bill also had a £2 cover charge per person – I really don’t understand what this is actually for when no music is being played!Anyway a great restaurant and one that we will re-visit time and time again no doubt."",Date of visit: June 2013,5,5,5,5,A safe bet and always good,UID_e4,UK,anonymized4"
"d731402,g186338,London,The Wolseley,Restaurant,""Popped in here for breakfast on a whim over Christmas period. Was absolutely buzzing at 11am. Almost didn't get a table (no booking). I was very hungry and thirsty as I had just done a few laps of Hyde Park. First disappointment was the fact that it took an way too long for the cappuccinos to arrive. They eventually turned up, when I prompted the waiter, after our food arrived. I went for the full English, which was perfectly acceptable, aside from the overly charred bacon (lots of it though) and the minute portion of black pudding (the highlight taste wise). My wife's French Toast though was totally decimated. I was slightly embarassed looking at this as I had been banging on about what an institution The W was. £48 for burnt food and 2 coffees is in no way acceptable.

The waiter made us feel that we should be honoured to eat there and that we were fortunate enough to be served by such an amazing person.The food was medicore, the shell fish dishes had all but sold out (five on the menu and one available), the service lazy and the other diners were more interested at rubber necking who had just walked through the door rather than concentrate on their food.The only reason I suspect celebrities come here is convenience before heading for its members only club upstairs.

Fantastic mix of punters from established regulars to eager youngsters and people on business smashing the lobster fruit de mer. Was buzzing all evening. Menu isn't that big but it was so hard to chose. I kicked off with the sauted octopus with chorizo and broad beans. Pretty simple but very effective. Followed this up with the mixed roasted shell fish. Standard fair with half a lobster";" 3 juicy prawns and one of the scallops with chorizo off the starters menu. The real star though was the razor clams. Not sure what herbs they were cooked in but they were mouth watering. In my opinion every good fish restaurant needs a quality dessert selection. I couldn't help but noticing the adjacent table ordering off menu and having frozen mixed berries with hot white chocolate. Have had this before at Scotts a fair few times. If I have one slight reservation about the whole meal it was that the chocolate sauce could have been a little warmer. Minor gripe though, all the food was delicious.
